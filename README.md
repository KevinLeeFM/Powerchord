# Powerchord
 A game for a Repl.it code jam that allows players to create music using musical techniques employed in heavy metal music. The created music can then be downloaded as MIDI file.

## Instructions

You are a galactically-famous guitar artist, and as per usual a part of tonight's performance is to fend off an endless hoard of insectoid fans from your sacred stage. Play your electric guitar and produce divine notes to satiate their fanaticism (if you can hit them, that is).

Produce notes by HOLDING (not tapping) the keys from the top keyboard letter row, eaching corresponding to a powerchord on the "Metallica" or locrian/aeolian mixed scale as well as a location on the stage:

If you play your powerchord on the snares (the "boom!") of the drumbeat, you will produce an accented note, which will deal double the musical splendour against your fans.

When the game is over, you can listen over the masterpiece that you've created! You can also download it as a MIDI file (WIP), or in a JSON format.

- Green bugs take 1 musical splendour to defeat
- Purple bugs takes 10 musical splendour to defeat
- Your green notes deals 1 musical splendour
- Your accented notes deals 5 musical splendour

Keep your eyes peeled for purple bugs!

## Strategy

Do not think that increasing BPM gives you an advantage: doing so also increases bug spawn rate!

Sometimes you may see bugs clump together on one column, that's because they're demanding you to play a pedal of that note. Keep one finger hovering on that note and default to it when that column gets out of hand.

Some riffs to try out for your fans if the bugs are not bothersome to you:
```
Q.R.T.Y.Q.Y.T.R.
Q.E.R.T.U.I.W.....
Q.......Y...T.R.
```

If you want to imitate heavy metal music, make sure to ocassionally jump to and linger on W or Y. They're the nastiest notes in the scale.
